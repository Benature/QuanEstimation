# QuanEstimation

This is a preliminary version. This package can be used to perform some calculations in quantum parameter estimation. 
Currently we have two versions.  

1) Independent version: It only requires the basic packages like numpy. 

2) qutip version: it is based on the package QuTiP (http://qutip.org/). 

Functions included:
1. Quantum Fisher information (matrix)

Control algorithm included:
1. GRAPE
